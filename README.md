## 📚 Course Structure & My Progress

I have organized the repository into folders corresponding to each day's topic.

### ➡️ [Day 1: Introduction to Agents](./Day1_Introduction_to_Agents/)
* **Topic:** Foundational concepts of AI agents, their defining characteristics, and how agentic architectures differ from traditional LLM applications.
* **Status:** Completed. Notes and codelabs are in the folder.

### ➡️ [Day 2: Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP](./Day2_Tools_and_Interoperability/)
* **Topic:** Understanding how AI agents can "take action" by leveraging external functionalities and APIs, and exploring the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
* **Status:** In Progress.

### ➡️ [Day 3: Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory](./Day3_Context_Engineering/)
* **Topic:** Building AI agents that can remember past interactions and maintain context using short-term and long-term memory.
* **Status:** Not Started.

### ➡️ [Day 4: Agent Quality](./Day4_Agent_Quality/)
* **Topic:** Mastering the critical disciplines of evaluating and improving agents, including observability, logging, tracing, and key performance metrics.
* **Status:** Not Started.

### ➡️ [Day 5: Prototype to Production](./Day5_Prototype_to_Production/)
